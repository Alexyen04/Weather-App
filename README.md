# Weather-App
A weather app that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts for any city worldwide.

## Project Description
This weather app provides users with real-time weather updates and forecasts for any location worldwide. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface where users can easily search for and view current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

- The application fetches data from the Accuweather API and displays current weather data and forecasts for any location entered by the user. It provides weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, making it easy for users to plan their day.

- Python was chosen for its simplicity and our team wanting to gain knowledge in using the language. Tkinter was selected as the GUI framework due to it being included in python and its ability to create a straightforward, responsive user interface. Together, these technologies allow for the rapid development of a functional and accessible weather application.

- Some challenges we faced included front end with implementing a background on top of a grid layout in Tkinter, which required balancing aesthetic design with functionality. In the future, we hope to add more modern designs to the program to enhance the user experience. We plan to implement a search bar feature that saves recently searched locations for quicker access to frequently checked cities. Additionally, we aim to develop a mobile version of the app, bringing its functionality and ease of use to mobile devices as we feel our program is more suited for mobile devices than computers.
